After seeing a picture on Twitter about how many guys on the 2001 Miami team were drafted it was clear to see why they are considered the most talented Depth Chart in college football history. Of the guys listed on the depth chart that were not redshirting there were 39 total drafted with 17 being First Round draft picks. Being an Alabama fan I was curious as to how our rosters in recent years have stacked up. I decided to start with 2010 since it was really the first full roster of Saban. The point of Draft Scratchers is to look at picks that were universally panned at the time, and that everyone criticized. It’s the series about the picks that left people scratching their heads at the time. It’s the series about the picks that make you go hmmm (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF2ayWcJfxo). It’s the series about the picks where you wonder what they were thinking and where you’re first guessing; it’s the series about picks that seemed bizarre, out of left field, and seemed I've seen many people don't believe that Kubica has in fact, a worse car than Russell. In a post-race interview he said that the car driveable only on fresh tires. Take a look at the graph. Gap to lead (https://i.redd.it/2ni2je6zmip21.png) First stint: KUB on fresh meds, RUS on fresh softs. KUB's pace is slightly better than RUS's. RUS used DRS to overtake KUB and KUB just stayed behind him for the rest of the stint. Then Williams makes a weird decision to bring KUB in early. Second stint:. A lot of talk about pick #60 and why it has such importance to the Braves as it relates to Kimbrel's free agency. The MLB draft is tough to follow, you have to research several drafts to understand the returns. There are draftees who take 4-5 years to develop while there are others (college players namely) that could only take 2-3. There are teams who are in win-now mode and others who want to win in 3-5. It's easy to say " Pick 60 is such a 'what-if'! Trade it for a known commodity!" Hey - Pat from StarterStory.com (https://www.starterstory.com) here with another interview.

TL;DR Baseball measures how much better a player is than average, and I wanted to find an equation that mimics that in Rocket League. Basically, I found values that determines a player's offensive ability and their defensive ability, and added those values together. I then used a value that is everyone else's offensive and defensive ability averaged together, and subtracted that value from the player's "WAR" to compare them to the average player. Here is what the equation looks #Introduction The 2010s have been an interesting year for music as a whole, and metal especially. We have seen many trends all throughout the various subgenres, but one has been talked about much more frequently than its peers. A genre that is as loved as much as it is hated, this is the genre of blackgaze. First taking roots in the later years of the 2000s it grew to immense popularity in the 2010s and has grown to its own international scene, with pioneers of the style coming I volunteered myself to name the all-time 53-man roster for the Denver Broncos because of my love for the team, my love of stats, and my love of writing. I'm not going to give you some long, hokey intro detailing the entire team's history, but I feel like it might be important to know my basis for selection. amp#x200B; First of all, I only considered what each player did while they were with the Broncos. There may have been players with very storied careers who only played for the Broncos. Usually I like to stay Positive about the Nationals. Which at times seems to be a far cry from this subs reaction. I like baseball, I like watching baseball, and even if the Nationals lose, most nights I don't mind. amp#x200B; However, as we all know these past few weeks have been very frustrating. Its one thing to watch your team lose when they play a good game. Watching them play like highschoolers is far from fun. Why does this keep happening though? In a team seemingly studded First post, on mobile, English is my first language, TLDR at the bottom, bear with me. Forgive me is it's long. I may have to divide this up into parts. This is a complex web of cancerous chaotic hell. I'm going to keep this as family friendly and PG as possible.
