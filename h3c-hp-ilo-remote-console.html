HP iLO Integrated Remote Console это программное обеспечение Shareware в категории (2), разработанная Hewlett-Packard. Ordered 6 and one is super slow. Can't even remote or navigate the menu or update it. The other 5 are fine. It's been awhile since I've used ilo, been using ipmi, ibms and this is our first HP in 10 years. Any suggestions.

I had to check the console of two hp proliant dl360 g6 (_ not so bad for the customer needs _ )  In both cases the ilo (ilo2) worked but with expired certificate. I tried to open the remote console with Java (ready to make security exception for the url) but java said "class not found", i guess i should install java6 or something instead of java8. Ok i tried with the activeX plugin, using ie11  I put the url in the trusted sites, i executed the activeX installation but the `.cab` gets blocke. Одной из основных замечательных вещей в серверах HP является наличие интерфейса удаленного управления Integrated Lights Out (ILO). Hi. Hopefully someone might be able to help me. I've had my DL580 G7 up for a few days while I tried to get snmp data pulled into telegraf to translate into some sexy graphs in Graphana. I recently got snmp working in ESXi (somehow, I don't remember) when all of the other suggestions didn't work/caused a PSOD. Problem is: I shut down properly, turned off my VMs, turned off my server from the ESXi interface via shutdown host. Went to install matching 8GB 103000 DDR3 x 2 RAM and booted 
Новая лицензия iLO Advanced Premium Security Edition, доступная только на серверах HPE ProLiant Gen10, обеспечивает все возможности управления, предоставляемые лицензией iLO Advanced, а также функции обеспечения безопасности высокого класса. I have an HP Proliant Gen 9 server running Server 2016. It is in a bootloop with BSOD. I have iLO access to the machine currently, but otherwise the server is 2 hours away for a drive. With the iLO access I can pull a remote console and do most features on the server. The hardware checkups are coming back clean it looks to be an OS issue. Is there anyway to try to repair the OS from a bootable iSO or USB. I can mount those through the iLO. Unfortunately this is kind of outside my knowledge realm.  4 thoughts on “How to access HP’s ILO remote console via SSH” phanishanker September 27, 2016 at 04:53. Hey keeran, Thanks for sharing. However when i tried TEXTCONS 
Hi Fellow Admins, I've been a Sysadmin for about nearly 10 years now, the last several have been supporting a Mixed vendor, mixed configuration, rapidly changing network environment. I have found most remote management utilities to be underselling and all "single-pane" systems to be anything but since. I want to design and create a new combined remote management and monitoring system that could be usable by organization of any size, whether Windows Domain or otherwise. I'm still flushing HP iLO also offers faster time to resolution due to its remote access and troubleshooting features, where users can remotely access the server using an industry standard scriptable interface, remote console, or Virtual Media features to perform various basic management functions. In addition, its embedded support (Direct Connect and Remote Support) reduces time, cost and complexity. So recently purchased a HP DL380 G6 at auction kind of on a whim. Had been looking around this sub and reading up a bit for awhile thought I was reasonably prepared. I was not. So after not being able to get the server to output to known good display I spent some time getting ILO 2 working on a modern system. Got ILO 2 working, and ILO 2's remote console working, and the server is still not displaying anything. Try clearing the cmos by switching switch 6 on system maintenance switch reattachi.

Hi everyone, I want to thank who has helped me so far with getting my ML350p Gen8 server up and running, I have successfully migrated all my Hyper-V VM's over now and so far things are running smoothly! One slight kink I've run into (hopefully others had the same problem and know the solution) is with iLO remote console. With all the messing around I've done on my server getting things set up, I've accidentally killed all network access. I've tried going in through iLO remote console iLO provides some other utilities like virtual media (CD, floppy), virtual power and a remote console. iLO is either embedded on the system board, or available as a PCI card. iLO is either embedded on the system board, or available First of all excuse me if I missed something obvious, but I have completely no experience with HP hardware so far. Last week I picked-up HP Microserver Gen8 to add to my lab. I cannot get keyboard (either iLO one via Remote Console nor USB one) to work after booting to debian. Both keyboards are working perfectly during POST or in GRUB. I don't have any custom kernel options, besides `drm=0` (to make `TEXTCONS` working). Kernel log looks normal from what I could see on the screen, however. iLO, iLO2, iLO3 and iLO4 Advanced License Activation Keys iLO 2 Advanced features have been activated. iLO Advanced License Keys: 247RH-ZPJ8S-7B17D-FCE55-DDD17. I've long used HP Proliant servers (mostly DL380 line) in our company, but lately HP has been screwing up so badly in so many ways I've come to just despise them. I'm interested in feedback on comparable alternatives. I'm not interested in white-box servers or other no-names that lack enterprise feature sets and support. The Proliant line has been my go-to almost since it's inception back when it was Compaq, and over the years I have had the opportunity to use both Dell and IBM/Lenovo I have an odd problem. I have to install a fact to check whether the server is physical (in my case checking for hp ilo is enough). So i install the following fact to the server /etc/ansible.d/facts/hp-hardware.fact #!/bin/bash if /usr/sbin/hponcfg -g grep Firmware gt /dev/null ; then cat ltltEOF { "hp-hardware" : "true", "user" : "$(whoami)" } EOF else cat ltltEOF { "hp-hardware" : "false", "user" : "$(who. We use HP servers that have iLO in them, and I'm considering buying the advanced licenses for them to enable Remote Console functionality. I have a few questions though: Are there different licenses for different server models or iLO versions? Or is there just a single 'iLO Advanced' license that can be applied to any server? A quick google search showed me that licenses are available for sale on Amazon. There is a wide range of prices on amazon for what look like the same thing. Hoping the VMware community can point me in the right direction to troubleshoot my HBA failure in one of my HP DL380 G7 servers running ESXi 6. The host has a P812 controller with 8 (600GB) drives in RAID 5, making up one LUN (0). ESXi is installed on a 32 GB SD Card on the mobo. When I went to vCenter to do some VM work, I noticed IO errors in Dsmeg for my hosts. Then noticed that (at the time) the data store was full on the host Summary tab. After having a meltdown thinking that I could. I bought an HP DL380G2 from Baddog a while back (still waiting on those rails I was promised months ago, BTW). Despite HP's best efforts I managed to navigate their site to find an iLo trial license since it's required to use the remote console feature. I've decided this is invaluable to me as in the future I plan to do a lot of reinstalling on this server and since it's in the basement, the remote console saves me a ton of grief. Unfortunately, HP has succeeded in their 
Hi there, Up until i updated my iLo firmware to 4 the android app used to work both with the interface and the remote console. After upgrading remote console stopped working (crashes my Galaxy S7 Edge every single time). Also it seems like the last time the app was updated was years ago (14th Feb 2013) and the email address provided for support is also dead (ilo@hp.com) Is there any news on this? Is the Android App dead? edit: it does however metnion "Limitations: - HP ProLiant servers. We have a couple of HP C7000 G2 blade racks. We run Windows 2k8 and 2012 R2 servers on them. I've had this problem occurring now and then. If I try to reboot a server from a RDP session it will never come back online.
